to install this, just run 
$./configure OR $./directinstall 
$make (only if you configure it) 


in the src directory
Run make to compile code
an object file scfs will be created 
use this to mount the directories,

eg: 

$./scfs dir1/ dir2/ 

^this will mount dir1 on dir2 with the fileoperations implemented in our Filesystem
you can check if its "actually" mounted by 

$ mount | grep "scfS" 

to check the filesystem type you can run the command 
$df -h -T
